    <p class="paragraph_about_team">Welcome to our webpage. The team name is BrainStorm. Our purpose by selecting this name was to demonstrate the strength of brains when we got together and think about a certain issue. Team members are talented and they are elected with more intelligence among others. Furthermore, for this assignment, the site Codecademy helped us a lot. We have had basic information about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however, a certain site supported us to improve our skills. HTML was the skeleton of the webpage, we worked on it hard and tried to accomplish well-decorated and simple to use. After that, we used to style an HTML document, and CSS described to us how HTML elements should be displayed. Finally, we learned the basics of JavaScript and it really helped us to create interesting and well-designed animation which makes our webpage more modern and amazing.</p>
