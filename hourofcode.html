  <h2 class="text">Hour of code was our first journey from this course. it was memorable and worth doing it. let's talk about what we improved what we learned and so on. We starts our journey with 8th grade at school No207. We learned how to manage our time perfectly and how to teach. We made a friendly atmosphere for better class management and better communication. Everything was prepared before hand. Of course as humans we had some problems for example some of the computers didn't work at all. Now let's go how we started. So, first our team member Ramiz introduced ADA university to students. if you were there, you could see that most of the students were interested in ADA university. After presentation students asked questions and we give brief answers to their questions. Then Amin started to introduce "code.org" and started a video game in that site for better explanation. Then we gave them task in site and most of the students were satisfied because task was very easy and interesting to them. And yes they had some problems but we managed to help them. After everything finished we took a picture as a collective and when we were leaving students said that they will miss us.</h2>
